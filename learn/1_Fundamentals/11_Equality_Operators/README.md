# Equality Operators

Equality operators are used to compare two values for equality. They help determine whether the values on both sides are equal or not, and they return a boolean result (True or False).

## Equality (==)

Checks if the values on both sides are equal.

```py
a = 5
b = 5
result = (a == b)  # True
```

## Inequality (!=)

Checks if the values on both sides are not equal.

```py
a = 5
b = 10
result = (a != b)  # True
```

## Exercise

Write a program that performs the following comparisons using equality operators and prints the results:

```py
x = 10
y = "apple"
z = True

print(x == 10)   # True
print(y == "banana")  # False
print(z != False)  # True
```
