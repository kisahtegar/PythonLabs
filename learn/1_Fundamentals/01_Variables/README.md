# Variables

A variable is a symbolic name that is used to store and represent data values. It is essentially a label or identifier for a memory location where a value is stored

```py
# Variable assignment
age = 20

# Variable reference
print("My age is:", age)
```

## Exercises

Write a program that creates three variables: name, age, and city, assigns values to them, and then prints those values

```py
name = "HuXn"
age = 20
city = "New York"

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("City:", city)
```
